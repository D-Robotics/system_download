Dear Developer Friends,

Due to GitHub's file size limitations and the challenges of using Git LFS, we’ve uploaded the files to Google Cloud for easier access. You can download them directly via this link:
RDK X3：[Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JEtCno5KZ9Na7ZxIWVqvm-LK78KLsJeO?usp=sharing)
RDK X5：[Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qyLpr1YnTD9v2_nzVE-E8beduR3nQb71/view)
Alternatively, you can use our file server to download the files:

If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to us anytime.

Let me know if any further adjustments are needed!
